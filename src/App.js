// important notes 
// 1.
// why this line - console.log(query.split("   ")) //['vccty'] -  is printing  this , on typing  vccty , while i applied split onto this and query is a string ?
// The `split()` method in JavaScript is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. In your case, you're using `"   "` (three spaces) as the separator. 
// When you type "vccty" into the input field, the `split()` method is called with `"   "` as the separator. However, "vccty" does not contain three spaces, so the `split()` method cannot find a place to split the string. As a result, it returns the entire string "vccty" as a single-element array.
// If you want to split the string into individual characters, you can use `""` (an empty string) as the separator:

// ```javascript
// console.log(query.split("")) // ['v', 'c', 'c', 't', 'y']
// ```
// If you want to split the string into words, you can use `" "` (a single space) as the separator:
// ```javascript
// console.log(query.split(" ")) // ['vccty']
// ```
// In these examples, the `split()` method can find places to split the string, so it returns an array of substrings. If there's still an issue, please let me know! ðŸ˜Š


// oh so one tab is equal to two spaces ?
// In many text editors and environments, a tab is often displayed as equivalent to 2 spaces or 4 spaces for readability. However, it's important to note that a tab (`\t`) is actually a different character from a space (` `) in terms of ASCII values. The exact display width of a tab can be configured in many text editors. If there's still an issue, please let me know! ðŸ˜Š
